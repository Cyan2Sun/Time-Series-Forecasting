# Time-Series-Forecasting on Stock Data
Time Series Analysis and Forecasting on Apple stocks using Python.
Project Overview
This project focuses on Time Series Analysis (TSA) and Forecasting using Apple stock data. The aim is to understand and predict the stock's behavior over time by analyzing its historical data and identifying underlying patterns and trends. The project employs various models and techniques to achieve accurate forecasting results.

Key Components of Time Series Analysis
Trend: Long-term increase or decrease in the data.
Seasonality: Regular patterns or fluctuations tied to specific intervals like seasons or months.
Cyclicity: Repeating patterns over a more extended period.
Irregularity: Unpredictable variations not explained by the trend, seasonality, or cyclic patterns.

Data Source
The dataset used for this project is Apple stock data, sourced from Yahoo Finance. The dataset includes the following fields:
1) Date
2) Closing Price
3) Opening Price
4) Highest Price
5) Lowest Price
6) Adjusted Closing Price
7) Volume

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves:
  Data cleaning and outlier identification
  Descriptive statistics for data quality enhancement
  Visual techniques (histograms, scatter plots) for pattern identification
  Feature engineering for deeper insights into variable relationships
  Time Series Forecasting Models
The project explores various forecasting models, including:
  ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average): Suitable for stationary data with autocorrelation.
  Exponential Smoothing Methods: Captures different levels of seasonality and trends.
  LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of recurrent neural network well-suited for complex sequential patterns.
Model Implementation
  ARIMA: Used for multi-step out-of-sample forecasting with re-estimation. The algorithm fits an ARIMA(4, 1, 0) model to the data.
  LSTM: Built using the Keras library and Theano. The model is trained and evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for accuracy.
Flask Web Development Integration
  The project includes the integration of predictive models into Flask, a Python web framework, to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the forecasting models. This integration bridges the gap between backend algorithms and frontend user interfaces, enhancing the practical application of the models.
